## Root Cause Summary

### The Problem: Dual Mock Systems

**Old System** (src/tests/test-utils.ts)
- Uses vi.fn() for each mock function
- Requires manual setup in every test
- No state persistence
- Fragile and verbose

**New System** (src/testing/mock-logseq-sdk/MockLogseqAPI.ts)
- Class-based with internal state
- Automatic ID resolution
- Built-in DataScript patterns
- Much cleaner and more maintainable

**Status:** New system exists but tests haven't migrated yet!

### The Impact

50+ tests fail because:
1. Mocks not wired with test data
2. DataScript queries don't match patterns
3. State not persisted between calls
4. Error handling not implemented

### The Solution

1. Consolidate old test-utils.ts to use MockLogseqAPI internally
2. Tests import from test-utils.ts but use better mocks underneath
3. Migrate test setup from `mockImplementation()` to `addPage()`, `addBlock()`
4. Fix core logic bugs revealed by proper mocks

## How to Use This Analysis

### Scenario 1: Planning the Fix
1. Read TESTING_PYRAMID_STRATEGY.md sections:
   - "Root Cause Analysis"
   - "Priority Fixing Order"
   - "Migration Plan"
2. Review "Files to Modify" section
3. Estimate 6-9 hour timeline
4. Break work into 3 phases

### Scenario 2: Implementing P1 Fixes (Mock System)
1. Read TEST_FAILURE_SUMMARY.md for context
2. Reference DETAILED_TEST_ANALYSIS.md for specific tests
3. Update src/tests/test-utils.ts
4. Run tests: `npm test -- referenceResolution`
5. Verify fixes with checklist

### Scenario 3: Implementing P2 Fixes (Core Logic)
1. Read DETAILED_TEST_ANALYSIS.md for each failing test
2. Review "Fix Required" code sections
3. Update src/markdownExporter.ts
4. Run tests per category
5. Verify with test coverage

### Scenario 4: Implementing P3 Fixes (Polish)
1. Read DETAILED_TEST_ANALYSIS.md for edge cases
2. Review "Fix Required" sections
3. Small, focused changes
4. Individual test fixes
5. Verify all tests pass

## Key Files to Modify

### Critical (Blocking Most Failures)
```
1. src/tests/test-utils.ts
   - Consolidate with MockLogseqAPI
   - Status: Foundation for all other fixes

2. src/markdownExporter.ts
   - Add null checks
   - Fix asset detection
   - Add error handling
   - Status: Core logic bugs
```

### High Impact (>10 failures each)
```
3. src/tests/unit/markdownExporter/assetDetection.test.ts
   - Migrate mocks (22 failing)

4. src/tests/unit/markdownExporter/referenceResolution.test.ts
   - Migrate mocks (11 failing)

5. src/tests/unit/markdownExporter/frontmatterGeneration.test.ts
   - Migrate mocks and fix edge cases (6 failing)
```

### Medium Impact (5-10 failures)
```
6. src/tests/unit/markdownExporter/blockProcessing.test.ts
   - Migrate mocks and implement indentation (4 failing)

7. src/tests/unit/hooks/useBatchExport.test.ts
   - Fix hook initialization (2 failing)

8. src/tests/unit/hooks/useAppVisible.test.ts
   - Fix return type (1 failing)
```

### Nice to Have (New feature)
```
9. src/tests/e2e/critical-flows.e2e.test.ts
   - Create new file with 3-5 critical tests
```

---

## Success Criteria

A fix is complete when:
- All 563 tests pass
- Coverage remains above 85%
- No test takes longer than 100ms
- Full suite completes in < 30 seconds
- MockLogseqAPI used consistently
- No vi.fn() mocks for Logseq API
- All error cases handled gracefully
- E2E tests cover critical flows

---

## Questions to Answer

**Q: Why so many failures?**
A: New MockLogseqAPI created but tests still use old vi.fn() mocks. 50+ tests fail from mock setup issues alone.

**Q: Is this a test infrastructure problem?**
A: No, the MockLogseqAPI is well-designed. This is a migration incompleteness problem (80%) + logic bugs (20%).

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: 6-9 hours for experienced developer. Break into 3 phases for parallel work.

**Q: Should we rewrite tests?**
A: No, just migrate mocks. Tests are well-structured, just using wrong mocks.

**Q: What about component/integration tests?**
A: All passing! Only unit tests affected. Component and integration tests work fine.
